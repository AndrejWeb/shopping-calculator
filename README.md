## Shopping Calculator

Utility / Shopping Calculator. Choose or set your own currency, add as many items as you need, enter price and get total cost. Export to PDF, HTML, CSV available.

The entered values are used on the fly and not getting saved in database because no database is being used. This is something you could create or I may do it in the future.

To run the project on your web server, first run in the root directory
    
    composer install

This will install the html2pdf library necessary for PDF export.

Now you're good to go and navigate to project destination in browser.
